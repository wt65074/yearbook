                    Senior spring is gone, and unfortunetely for us, so is the time to appreciate the friendships that
                    we had worked so hard to foster over our four years at Stanford.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    However, we believe that this isnâ€™t the end. We believe that the friendships that you have, both
                    small and large, can continue on in a meaninful way throughout your life. And it starts by taking
                    the time to appreciate each other in this time of extreme uncertainty.
